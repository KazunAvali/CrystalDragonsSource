[c/3ABC7A:Description:]
The Crystal Dragons are a set of 7 dragon-like races based on Terraria's gemstones that provide impactful stat changes and unique 10-minute cooldown abilities for an interesting twist on the Terraria experience. Each race comes with a unique sprite and an always-displayed faintly glowing horn based on the gemstone of their species.

This mod was made for Terraria's 10th anniversary, and is based on the characters of my friend group that was first formed because of a Terraria playthrough. I dedicate this mod to Lake Gang:
Jave, Ghil, Drue, Ruggust, and Hetuni (who is very small).

Each race has its own playstyle:
• [c/8732a8:Amethyst Dragon:] Summoner / Healer. Mainly focuses on supporting their team.

• [c/13f0cb:Diamond Dragon:] Melee / Tank. Frontlines-focused, has more defenses and health than average.

• [c/d4b30f:Topaz Kobold:] All-rounder. Can use pretty much anything, but not as efficiently as the specialists. Great support because of their unique prefixes granted from their 10-minute ability.

• [c/9c0e0e:Ruby Dragon:] Ranged (Guns) / Offense. Strong spike damage and inherent wings, but not very good at much else besides guns and explosives and can't use magic.

• [c/cc9a3d:Amber Raptor:] Ranged (Bows) / Scout. Fast and maneuverable, but only really good with bows.

• [c/2a57de:Sapphire Dragon:] Mage / Offense. Better innate magic abilities and high damage potential with 10-minute ability, gain bonuses while submerged or in rain, but fragile due to half immunity frames and only really good at magic.

• [c/105723:Emerald Dragon:] Melee, Throwing (& Rogue) / Offense. Focused on critical hits, having high base crit and dealing more damage with crits, but less damage with non-crits.

[c/3ABC7A:Changelog:]
1.7.3
- Fixed a bug with Topaz Kobolds being unable to use difficulty-changing items such as Revengeance while in Multiplayer.
NOTE: This fix required the removal of the functionality for HUGE walls being considered sunlight-blocking. This may cause problems in particularly large builds if there isn't a ceiling nearby, you may be considered "exposed" even if you're behind a large wall. I may look into fixing this later but this is MrPlague's code, so I need to look more deeply into the specifics for a fix here.

1.7.2
- Fixed a bug with the Gem Lock buff that caused the buff to repeatedly turn on and off while in range under certain game configurations.

1.7.1
- Fixed a bug where non-crystal-dragons would get an "ERROR: FindDragonType failed! Returning 0 (amethyst)" message spammed repeatedly in chat.

1.7.0
- Added Bonuses when nearby a Gem Lock with a slotted gem corresponding to your Dragon's gem (e.g. Amethyst Gem Locks only provide bonuses for Amethyst Dragons). These bonuses can stack up to 5 times:

• [c/8732a8:Amethyst:] Increases the regen provided by Amethyst Aura by 1 per gem (Max +5).
• [c/13f0cb:Diamond:] Reduces damage taken by 2% per gem (Max -10%).
• [c/d4b30f:Topaz:] Increases the likelihood of rolling a rare prefix by 2.5% per gem (base chance ~16%, max bonus brings this to ~28.5%). At 5 stacks, also increases the chance of the legendary prefix from 0.5% to 0.8%.
• [c/9c0e0e:Ruby:] Increase Gun/Explosive damage by 2% per gem (max +10%)
• [c/cc9a3d:Amber:] Increase Bow speed by 4% per gem (max +20%)
• [c/2a57de:Sapphire:] Reduce mana cost by 2% per gem (Max -10%)
• [c/105723:Emerald:] Increases Melee, Thrown (Calamity-specific: and Rogue) crit chance by 2% per gem (Max +10%)

- Adjusted Spirit Codex unlocks to unlock earlier. Now unlocks new spells after defeating Skeletron, Wall of Flesh, and any Mechanical bosses (changed from WoF, Any Mech, and Plantera).
